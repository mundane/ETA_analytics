In this sprint we tried to implement as much functionality as posible, given our limited time. Our main focus was to finish items that were half done, hard coded, and yielded most added functionality. The app is far from done, but several key components are nearing done state. \\
We did not meet with the product owner, during this sprint, but he was made aware of our progress.

What went well:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Working together for extended periods of time meant that we got more done.

\end{itemize}
What went bad:
\begin{itemize}
	\item We had fewer working hours in this sprint, due to the group members busy schedules.
	\item We have a larger workload for the last sprint because of the reduced work in this sprint.
\end{itemize}
