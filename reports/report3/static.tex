\subsection{Static Code Analysis} % (fold)
\label{sub:Static Code Analysis}
There are not that many static code analysis tools for JavaScript. Mostly, people recommend JSlint (http://www.jslint.com/). We also looked at http://www.brics.dk/TAJS/, but we could not find any way to download it, so we chose to use JSlint, for its ease of use. A downside with using JSlint is that it is designed for online use, making it a cumbersome process to check a lot of code, copy/pasting it into the web site. Instead we used both a commmand line interface version of JSlint, via the node.js package manager, and JShint, (http://www.jshint.com/) that has plugins for different text-editors, allowing us to check our code while we write it. We also looked at Google's closure compiler, (https://developers.google.com/closure/), which both does static code analysis and minification of the code.\\
Futher down the line we would like to integrate static code analysis in the build process. We will most likely be using Google's closure compiler to do that. Or just use coffeescript, (http://coffeescript.org/) which compiles to JavaScript, through JSlint.\\
Using JSlint on our project in its current state did not reveal any critical bugs or the like in our code. Mostly JSlint complains about wrong indentation and missing ``use strict;'' statements.
