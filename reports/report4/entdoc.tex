Chosing to build our application in JavaScript means that finding a documenting tool was not particular easy, as tools like JavaDoc and doxygen are not applicable to JavaScript. In our research we happened upon JSdoc, \url{http://code.google.com/p/jsdoc-toolkit}, dox, \url{https://github.com/visionmedia/dox}, and docco, \url{http://jashkenas.github.com/docco/}. JSdoc had the advantage that they use the same anotation as JavaDoc and also produced output that is visually and structurally similar to what JavaDoc outputs. The main downside of JSdoc is the setup. The cli version requires a rather cumbersome configuration to work with a project like ours, in that we rely heavily on other frameworks, code that we do not need to be handled by the documentation tool.
