\label{sec:Architectural Description}

In the following we will be describing the current software architecture for our system. An architectural description could be used as a basis for stakeholder communication, as part of an on-going software design process or to evaluate different architectures \cite{christensen}. In the following we will be using the recommendations found in \cite{christensen} to describe the software architecture. In particular we will be using different viewpoints to communicate the overall structure of the system. In the following we will be looking at the model, C\&C view respectively, we will not be looking at the deployment view in our case, as our system is simple enough that this view would not add much to an overview.
