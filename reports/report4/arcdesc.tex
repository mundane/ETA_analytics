\label{sec:Architectural Description}

In the following we will be describing the current software architecture for our system. An architectural description could be used as a basis for stakeholder communication, as part of an on-going software design process or to evaluate different architectures \cite{christensen}. In the following we will be using the recommendations found in \cite{christensen} to describe the software architecture. In particular we will be using different viewpoints to communicate the overall structure of the system. In the following we will be looking at the model, C\&C and deployment view respectively.
