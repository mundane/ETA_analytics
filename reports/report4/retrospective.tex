In this sprint, we finished the intented work on documentation and code review, and implemented a file browser for the device, making it possible to find CSV files for our app. 

We didn't finish the work on testing. The test cases in Siesta took considerably more time than anticipated. We had problems making our developed methods available in the testing tool Siesta. 
This demanded more research on the setup and built-in functions of Siesta. Some possible soultions, is to research more on how Siesta works, redo our code so it 
fits better with the workings of Siesta or do unit testing without Siesta. All of these scenarios will demand more hours to complete.
