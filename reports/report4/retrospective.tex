In this sprint, we finished the intended work on documentation and code review,the highlights of this sprint is

\begin{itemize}
\item File Browser:A plug-in free pure JavaScript based File Browser.

\item Better Sprint Delegation:Better coordination on task and work assignment.

\item Refactoring Code:Updated Git with re-factored code.

\item Decided on and set up documentation tool for JavaScript.

On the other hand there were a few gritty tasks such as

\item Testing: Although we didn't finish the work on testing. Considerable time was spent on Siesta than originally anticipated. 
	 We had problems making our developed methods available in the testing tool. This demanded more research on the setup and built-in functions of Siesta. Some possible solutions, is to research more on how Siesta works, redo our code so it 
	 fits better with the workings of Siesta or do unit testing without Siesta. All of these scenarios will demand more hours to complete.

\item There is no really a "standard" way of documenting JavaScript code. This meant that more time had to be spend on finding proper tools for documentation in JavaScript.

\item Little feedback during code review process.

\end{itemize}
