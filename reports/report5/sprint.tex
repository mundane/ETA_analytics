\subsection{Sprint Explanation}
The burndown chart shows that, better coordination on task and work assignment helped in completing the taks planned for this sprint.

The project backlog and the graph with the hours we spent are at the end of this document in appendix \ref{sec:Scrum Material}. The reader should note that the graph are vector graphics, so zooming is posible. \\
As can be seen from our backlog we have added some user stories and kept on working on some from the previous sprint.
\subsection{User Stories}
For sprint \# 4 we worked on the following user stories: \\

As an analytic \\
I want to be able to browse files on the devices\\
So that I can view my files on the App \\

As a programmer\\
I want to have my project source code commented  \\
So that I can get a better overview \\

As an analytic\\
I want the graphics to scale to the screen size, when i turn the tablet between landscape and portrait format\\
So the graphics are changed to fit the screen\\

\subsection{Tasks} % (fold)
\label{sub:Tasks}
The stories are divided up into the following tasks
