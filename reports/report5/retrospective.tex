In this sprint, we lowered the expected work hours, because several group members were busy with work and other courses. This meant that we decided not to introduce new tasks, but focus on improving the tasks we had already worked on.
We also had a meeting with the product owner, where we agreed to limit the features in the program.

What went well:

\begin{itemize}
\item Profiling for graphs, so the graphics are displayed correct in portrait and landscape mode

\item Integrate file browser

\item Agreement with product owner to reduce the features
\end{itemize}
What went bad:
\begin{itemize}
\item We had fewer working hours in this sprint, due to the group members busy schedules.

\item We have a larger workload for the last sprint because of the reduced work in this sprint.

\end{itemize}
