\section{Process improvements} % (fold)
\label{sec:improvements}
To do process improvements, we had to investigate our existing processes. We looked at our earlier sprint retrospectives, to see what issues we had experienced before. 

\item We underestimated the time needed for many tasks, often because we had no prior experience with the subject and therefore had to research more than anticipated, this had the consequence, that we have not been able to implement as much as we hoped for, when we started the project.
\item In the first sprints, we often neglected to update the sprint material in time, which meant the information wasn't accurate. This cost time in the end of the sprints, as we had to fill out the missing data.

We had a workshop in the group, where we discussed what issues we saw in our project. One major issue was, that we didn't believe we could implement all that was planned in the first sprint. 
we therefore had a meeting with the product owner, where we talked about downsizing the project, because of the time issues. This was agreed upon, so we now only focus on importing a CSV file, showing the content of the file, and producing graphs of the data.

Another issue that came up in the workshop, was the quality of our code. We would like to refactor it to make it more efficient, and to comprimize it in the end to make it run faster.
