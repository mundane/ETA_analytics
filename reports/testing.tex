We used a testing tool developed for Sencha, called Siesta. Due to time restrictions, we didn't set up extensive testing, but made a simple test, to make sure that the elements of the MVC framework existed and could be reached from the app. \\
We chose Siesta, because it offers interesting testing possibilities for unit testing, such as simulating clicks and dragging of objects, which makes it easier to test user interface functionality. Other than that, the program has a lot of different built-in assertion functions, which will be useful for unit testing. When run, the program gives a visual overview of successful and failed tests, and gives an overview of where in the code an error is. The tests can be run from a GUI, which makes it easy to run the tests.
Siesta comes in two packages, where we use the free lite version. \\
We intend to use testing more intensively in the future sprints, but have not done so yet, because time was spend on other tasks, like graphing, export of graphs, and user experience elements for the app. \\
In this sprint we have not used a test-driven approach, while developing as part of the process has been to familiarize us with the Sencha framework.
